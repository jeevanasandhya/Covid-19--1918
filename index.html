                    <p>  The spread of the Spanish Flu has a strong relation to World War I.
                         Some suggest that the conditions of the War aided the spread of</p><p> the flu, 
                         while others argue that the Spanish Flu determined the course of the war. 
                         The conflict certainly helped the onset of the disease go unnoticed.</p>
                         <p>The first reported case is at Camp Funston <b><u>(a major military camp)</u></b> in Kansas,
                         United States, from which it spread to other</p><p> military camps around the US.
                         The troops then traveled and brought the flu over the Atlantic Ocean, 
                         where it first reached France and the Western</p><p>Front Countries
                         (Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland). 
                          It continued to spread from there to Eastern Europe and North Africa.</p>

                    <p>If you are wondering why this seemingly international event was dubbed the Spanish Flu,
                         this is because most countries</p><p>attempted to keep news of its spread quiet to avoid
                          mass hysteria. Spain was the first country to openly admit the gravity</p><p>of the situation.</p>
                      <p>It is also suggested that the<u><b style="color: cornflowerblue;">Spanish Flu originated from China</b></u>(red point), where laborers
                         were shipped across Canada</p><p> to serve Britain and France on the Western Front<u><b style="color:cornflowerblue;">during WWI.</b></u></p> </p>

                        death toll. Some suggest that this was caused by a mutated strain of the Spanish flu,
                        combined with rapid global troop movements of WWI. Scientists suggest that while symptoms
                        of the Spanish flu in the<b style="color: cornflowerblue;">first wave</b> has more similarity to that of the <b><u>seasonal flu,</u></b>
                        the mutated strain had the<b><u> ability to kill healthy young people within 24 hours.</u></b>
                        The first reported case is at a <b style="color: cornflowerblue;">naval base in Brest, France, where military personnel</b> from
                        different countries gathered, bringing the mutated strain of the flu with them.</p>
                        <p>Almost simultaneously, it spread to<b style="color:cornflowerblue">US military camps, first in Boston,</u></b> then to other camps
                        in the US. The rest of North America, Central America, and South America were hit, including
                        Brazil and the Caribbean region. 
                        From France, it also spread to<b>Freetown, Sierra Leone,</b> from which it hopped through the rest
                        of the African Continent along the <b><u>coast, rivers, and railways.</u></b> South Africa was also another
                         source of an <u >outbreak</u> where the flu was carried along the river Zambezi into Ethiopia.</p>

                   <div style="font-size: 30px;"> <u>These pandemics’ impact on the lives of women.</u></p></div> Much of the recently published literature 
                    compares various aspects of the<u> 2 pandemics—statistics, mitigation efforts, economic</u>
                    impact—but there has not been much comparison of gender issues and attitudes.
                    The 1918 influenza pandemic was pivotal in advancing women’s role in the workplace and
                    eventually the right to vote. However, as one of my colleagues recently wrote, COVID-19 
                    seems to have sent women backwards.</p>
                </div>

               <div><p>
                Women’s willingness to rise to the challenges of these positions not only allowed
                 them to gain social and financial independence, but also inspired them to become
                 more active in promoting women’s rights—including the right to vote. As a result 
                 of the pandemic, authorities banned crowds and large meetings, rendering women’s
                 rights activists unable to speak at election campaigns and rallies. With the right 
                 to vote hanging in the balance, suffragists quickly adapted their strategy to circulate
                  their message among smaller groups of neighbors and friends.</p>

                <div><p>The critical role women played throughout World War I and the H1N1 flu of
                     1918 earned them recognition in the political arena. Thanks to their momentous 
                     contributions, dedication to serving the nation and political perseverance, 
                     women eventually won the right to vote when the 19th Amendment was passed in 1920.</p>
                     <p>Today the world finds itself amid a pandemic, not entirely unlike that of 1918.
                        However, women have been hit particularly hard this time around, and as their
                        roles in society have shifted over the years, the systems meant to support
                        them have not kept up.
